This tutorial is a supplement to the paper, **Ready, Steady, Go AI: A Practical Tutorial on Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications in Plant Digital Phenomics** (submitted to *Patterns, 2021*) by Farid Nakhle and Antoine Harfouche. It aims to introduce the basic principles for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and explainable AI algorithms in image-based data analysis using the PlantVillage dataset to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases and spider mites as a case study.

Read the accompanying paper [here](https://doi.org) (a link will be available once the paper is published).

Our workflow involves four main steps:
1. Image Dataset Selection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Analysis
4. Performance Analysis and Explanation

As per our workflow, this repository is split into four directories. Each directory contains a description of its corresponding process, and ready to use, interactive notebooks that can run on Google Colab or any other platform supporting Jupyter notebooks.

Click on the directories listed above to proceed.
