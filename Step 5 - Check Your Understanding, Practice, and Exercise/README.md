# Ready, Steady, Go AI: A Practical Tutorial on Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications in Plant Digital Phenomics

## Step 5 - Check Your Understanding, Practice, and Exercise

Here, you will find a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), practices, and exercises to augment your learning by testing the knowledge you have acquired and by applying the concepts explained in practices and exercises.

These questions will help you identify good practices and develop troubleshooting skills that can come in useful when performing AI-based analysis.

For the MCQs, two Google Forms were developed:
1. The first asks questions about the basics of some of the topics covered in our manuscript.

2. The second, intended for the more experienced researchers, includes more advanced questions and is based on real-life scenarios that we have faced while developing our tutorial.

For the hands-on exercises and practices, three computational notebooks were developed to get you involved in coding:

1. The first requires you to complete simple parts of a provided code in order to run the tasks included in our workflow.

2. The second, intended for intermediates, involves you in writing more codes for the same tasks and modifying parts of it to help you practice.

3. The third, intended for the more experienced, asks you to write codes that reuse previously learned models (to crop and segment leaves) to preprocess images of apple leaves included in the PlantVillage dataset, and to train a new model that is able to identify and classify apple diseases and explain its decisions.

**All three notebooks contain the solutions stored in hidden code cells.**
