Here, you will find a set of self-test quizzes in form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and hands-on practices and exercises to augment your learning by testing the knowledge that you have acquired  throughout the tutorial, identify good practices, and develop troubleshooting skills that can be useful when performing AI-based image analysis.

For the quizzes, two Google Forms were developed:

**Google Form 1.** This form,  intended for beginner researchers, asks questions about the basics of some of the topics covered in the paper. **Access the quiz [here](https://forms.gle/mDyn1ExSZxRfxV1r6 "here").**

**Google Form 2.** This form, intended for the more experienced researchers, includes more advanced questions and is based on real-life scenarios that we have faced while developing our tutorial. **Access the quiz [here](https://forms.gle/1n6ngsNSeCZ7bJgK7 "here").**

For the hands-on practices and exercises, three computational notebooks were developed to get you involved in coding:

**Notebook 1.** This notebook, intended for beginner researchers, requires them to complete simple parts of a provided code in order to run the tasks included in the four-steps workflow discussed in the paper.

**Notebook 2.** This notebook, intended for intermediate researchers, involves them in writing more codes for the same tasks and modifying parts of it to help them practice.

**Notebook 3.** This notebook, intended for the more experienced researchers, asks them to write codes that reuse previously learned models (to crop and segment tomato leaves) to preprocess images of apple leaves included in the PlantVillage dataset and containing four classes of diseases (apple scab, black rot, cedar apple rust, and healthy). Next, it requires them to train a new model that is able to identify and classify apple diseases and explain its decisions.

**All three notebooks contain the solutions stored in hidden code cells.**
